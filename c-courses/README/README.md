# üìö C Programming - Basic Courses

This repository contains the codes and projects I developed during two **basic C programming**
courses that I took at **Estudo Nalta** and **Programe Seu Futuro**. 
These courses provide a comprehensive introduction to the C programming language, 
covering fundamental concepts and providing hands-on experience with various exercises.

## üîç What I learned:
- **Basic Syntax**: Understanding variables, data types, and operators.
- **Control Flow**: Using `if`, `else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- **Functions**: Creating and using functions, passing arguments, and returning values.
- **Arrays and Strings**: Working with one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, and manipulating strings.

## üíª Projects developed:
- **Simple Calculator**: A basic calculator application for arithmetic operations.
- **Number Guessing Game**: A game that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.
- **Diverse Programs**: Various simple programs to reinforce the concepts learned, such as string manipulation, 
    using loops and functions, and basic mathematical calculations.

## üéØ Objective:
To build a solid foundation in C programming, mastering the essential concepts and applying them to real-world problems. 
**I haven't finished the C course from Programe Seu Futuro yet**, both were taken as preparation for a college exam.
