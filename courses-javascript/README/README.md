üìö Website Creation Course - Beginner  
This repository contains the codes and projects I developed during my introductory website creation course,
using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental web technologies, 
laying a solid foundation for building modern and responsive websites.  

üîç What I intend to learn:  
- **HTML5**: Basic webpage structure, creating elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and forms.  
- **CSS**: Styling pages, controlling layouts, using selectors, styling properties, and introduction to techniques like Flexbox and Grid.  
- **JavaScript**: DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation, interactivity with events (clicks, keystrokes, etc.), flow control with conditionals and loops, and functions.  

üíª Projects developed:  
- **Personal Website**: A simple website with information about myself, using HTML5 and CSS for structure and styling.  
- **Interactive Calculator**: A basic calculator application built with HTML, CSS for layout, and JavaScript for functionality.  
- **Contact Form**: Creating a contact form that sends data (backend implementation not yet completed).  
- **To-Do List**: A simple to-do list app where users can add, edit, and delete tasks, with JavaScript for functionality.  
- **Image Gallery**: A responsive gallery displaying images with a lightbox feature, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

üéØ Goal:  
To develop essential skills for creating and styling functional, responsive websites, 
using the key web technologies to solve real-world design and interaction problems.
